To Do:
- use a reader that automatically reads the next entry inside the database,
  so DbReader doesn't have to read all files inside the database at once
- write a script or class to download the pbd xml files from the rcsb website
- write script or class to add hydrogen to the crystal structure,
  perhaps by using the code in phenix, however, phenix only can handle .pdb files not .xml
- write an interface to call the boost library for the clustering(java -> c++),
  attempts to do so by calling phenix in yoink (java -> python -> c++) failed for various reasons,
  i.e. using java native access (jna) failed because boost is not a native library
- write or use a writer to write the interaction list to either a file or the database
- clean up translateToMolecule() in PdbmlTranslator
- select right approach for the processor (process one element (MSAdaptive) or a list of elements (MSInteraction))
- make AdaptiveQMMMJob and MSAdaptiveQMMMJob more abstract to reduce the necessary code
- check necessity of DbProcessor, ConsoleWriter
- solve the issue of the PdbmlFileReader of reading one resource multiple times (instead of setting the resource to null)
- check if SeperationScript is necessary or if the version issue can be solved by the VersionConverter,
  if possible, get rid of remove unnecessary pdbml/v4X/generated folder
- add understandable commentary to all added or changed files
- make job names more intuitive
